# Deployment

This page describes the CI/CD process, environment variables, and deployment steps for **test-docs-workflow**.

## CI/CD Pipeline

- Automated tests run on every pull request.
- Builds are created and deployed to staging/production environments.
- Common tools: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CircleCI.

## Environment Variables

- Store sensitive data (API keys, DB credentials) in environment variables.
- Use `.env` files for local development and secret managers for production.

## Deployment Steps

1. Merge changes to the `main` branch.
2. CI/CD pipeline runs tests and builds the project.
3. On success, the build is deployed to the target environment.
