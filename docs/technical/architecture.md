# Architecture

**test-docs-workflow** is a simple React website for browsing and viewing recipes.

## Main Components

- **React Frontend**: The entire application is built using React. All recipe data is stored locally (e.g., in JSON files or as static content).
- **Static Hosting**: The site can be deployed to GitHub Pages or any static site host. There is no backend server or database.

## How It Works

- Users can browse a list of recipes, view details, and search/filter recipes.
- All data and logic are handled client-side in the browser.

_No backend, API, or database is required for this project._
