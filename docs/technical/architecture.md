# Architecture

The **test-docs-workflow** project is designed with modularity and scalability in mind. Its architecture consists of the following main components:

- **Frontend**: User interface built with modern web technologies, providing an intuitive experience.
- **Backend API**: Handles business logic, authentication, and data processing.
- **Database**: Stores persistent data securely and efficiently.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automates testing, building, and deployment.

## Component Relationships

- The frontend communicates with the backend API via REST endpoints.
- The backend interacts with the database for data storage and retrieval.
- CI/CD ensures code quality and automates deployments to production environments.
