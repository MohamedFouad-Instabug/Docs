The application has undergone a major transformation from a simple recipe viewer to a comprehensive recipe management platform called RecipeHub 2.0. Key features include user authentication (via `AuthContext` and `api.js`), enhanced data structure (see `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md`), user management, a rating and review system, advanced search and filtering, a UI/UX overhaul, and a new n8n workflow for automated documentation (`n8n-workflow-design.md`).  The documentation should be updated to reflect these significant architectural and feature changes. Specifically, update the architecture overview to describe service layer, state management, and UI/UX enhancements. Add sections detailing business features like user management, rating, search, and social features.
