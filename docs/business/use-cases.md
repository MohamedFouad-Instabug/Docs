The RecipeHub 2.0 application has undergone significant architectural and feature enhancements, evolving from a simple recipe viewer to a comprehensive recipe management platform. Key changes include:

- **Architectural Changes:**
  - Implementation of JWT-based authentication with secure token management using React Context API.
  - Creation of a service layer architecture for centralized API communication and error handling.
  - Enhancement of the recipe data structure to include more metadata (category, difficulty, dietary info, ratings).
  - Overhaul of state management using React Context and useReducer for complex state handling.

- **Business Feature Changes:**
  - Introduction of a user management system with registration, login, and customizable profiles.
  - Implementation of a recipe rating and review system with 5-star ratings and user reviews.
  - Enhancement of search and filtering capabilities with real-time search and multiple filters.
  - Enhancement of recipe display with recipe cards, detailed views, and dietary tags.
  - Introduction of social features, including recipe sharing and user comments.

- **UI/UX Improvements:**
  - Complete design overhaul with glassmorphism, gradient backgrounds, and a modern color scheme.
  - Addition of new components such as header, search and filter section, recipe cards, and modal dialogs.
  - Implementation of interactive elements like hover effects, smooth transitions, and loading states.

- **Technical Improvements:**
  - Code organization into directories such as context and services.
  - Comprehensive error handling in the API service layer.
  - Performance optimizations using useEffect hooks, memoization, and optimized re-renders.

- **Testing and Quality:**
  - Adoption of development tools like ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript.
  - Improved code quality with consistent formatting, type checking, and linting rules.

These changes significantly expand the application's use cases:

- **Registered Users:** Create personalized recipe collections, rate and review recipes, and engage with a community of cooks.
- **Dietary Restricted Users:** Easily filter recipes based on dietary needs (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free).
- **Recipe Contributors:** (Future) Contribute recipes and manage their own content.
- **React Learners:**  A complex, real-world example of using React Context, API service layers, and advanced UI design.
- **Teams implementing CI/CD pipelines:** A demonstration of how to integrate CI/CD with code linting, testing, and automated documentation.

Consider adding a section to describe the n8n workflow and how it can be adapted to automate documentation creation for other projects.
