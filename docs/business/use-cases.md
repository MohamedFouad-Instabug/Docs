The application has been completely overhauled and transformed from a basic recipe viewer into RecipeHub 2.0, a full-featured recipe management platform. Key changes include a complete architectural rewrite with new authentication and service layers, user management, a rating and review system, a modern UI/UX design, and a scalable foundation for future growth. It has also been refactored to TypeScript. This introduces user accounts, personalized experiences, recipe ratings for community feedback, saved recipes for user retention, and social features for community building.  The frontend incorporates a glassmorphism design with gradient backgrounds.  The backend relies on a service layer architecture for API integration, modular components for easy maintenance, and comprehensive error handling in the API service. n8n workflows automate documentation updates based on GitHub Pull Requests using AI analysis.
