The application has undergone a major transformation, evolving from a simple recipe viewer to a comprehensive recipe management platform, RecipeHub 2.0. Key changes include:

- **Architectural Overhaul:** Introduction of authentication, a service layer, and robust state management using React Context and useReducer.
- **New Business Features:** Implementation of user management with dietary preferences, recipe rating and review system, advanced search and filtering, and basic social features.
- **UI/UX Improvements:** A complete design overhaul adopting glassmorphism, new components, and interactive elements for enhanced user experience.
- **Package Updates:** Project renamed to 'recipehub', version updated to 2.0.0, and addition of dependencies like react-router-dom, axios, and others to support new features.
- **Testing & Quality:** Implementation of ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript for improved code quality and maintainability.

The new service layer architecture introduces an API at `src/services/api.js` which serves as the central communication point with the backend. The file provides modular API methods for authentication, user management, recipes, ratings/reviews, social features, file uploads, and more.

The data structure for recipes has been significantly enhanced to include categories, difficulty, preparation time, cooking time, serving sizes, dietary information (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free), ratings, and tags. This extended structure facilitates advanced filtering and provides more detailed recipe information to the user.

A new automated documentation workflow using n8n has been designed, as described in `n8n-workflow-design.md`, for generating documentation from pull requests. This workflow automates the process of analyzing code changes and creating documentation updates.

To reflect these changes, the following use cases should be added to the documentation in `docs/business/use-cases.md`:

- **Personalized Recipe Recommendations:** Tailor recipe suggestions based on user dietary restrictions and preferences.
- **Collaborative Cooking:** Enable users to share, rate, and review recipes within the community.
- **Automated Documentation Updates:** Ensure documentation stays up-to-date with the latest features and architectural changes.
- **API Integration:** Support developers looking to integrate with RecipeHub's API for recipe management.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):** This project introduces CI/CD best practices to the project, making it simpler to deploy and more stable overall.
