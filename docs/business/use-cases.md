The RecipeHub application has undergone significant changes, evolving from a basic recipe viewer to a full-featured recipe management platform. Key updates include:

*   **Authentication System:** Implemented JWT-based authentication, persistent login sessions, and user profile management.
*   **Service Layer Architecture:** Introduced a centralized API communication layer for efficient data handling and error management.
*   **Enhanced Data Structure:** Revamped the recipe data structure with categories, dietary information, ratings, and user data.
*   **State Management Overhaul:** Adopted React Context + useReducer for managing complex application state.
*   **User Management System:** Added user registration, login, profiles with dietary restrictions, and saved recipes functionality.
*   **Recipe Rating & Review System:** Integrated a 5-star rating system with user reviews and average rating calculations.
*   **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Enhanced search capabilities with real-time search, category filtering, dietary options, and difficulty levels.
*   **UI/UX Improvements:** A complete design overhaul with glassmorphism, gradient backgrounds, and responsive design.

This upgrade transforms RecipeHub into a robust tool for home cooks, chefs, and anyone interested in discovering and managing recipes.  The added n8n workflow enables automatic documentation updates based on pull requests.
