Based on the changes, the following updates are suggested for the documentation repository:

1.  **Update Overview Section:**  The README.md should be updated to reflect the evolution of the application from a simple recipe viewer to a comprehensive recipe management platform (RecipeHub 2.0). Highlight the key new features such as user authentication, rating system, advanced search & filtering, social features, and UI/UX improvements. The description of the project in README.md should be revised to describe these changes.

2.  **Add a Migration Guide:** A section detailing the breaking changes (Recipe data structure, state management, styling, authentication) and migration considerations should be added to the documentation.

3.  **Update Technology Stack Details:** The documentation should list the new dependencies added in package.json: react-router-dom, axios, jwt-decode, react-hook-form, react-query, react-hot-toast, framer-motion, react-intersection-observer, react-virtualized, date-fns, lodash, and clsx. Each dependency should be briefly explained and justified in the context of the new functionality.

4.  **Document Authentication System:**  A new section dedicated to documenting the authentication system should be created, explaining the JWT-based authentication, React Context API usage, localStorage integration, and protected routes.

5.  **Document API Service Layer:** Create a separate documentation page for the API service layer (`src/services/api.js`), outlining the available methods, request/response structure, and error handling.

6.  **Add documentation on new components and UI/UX improvements**: The documentation should include how the glassmorphism design was implemented, the color-coded dietary tags, and the responsive design.

7.  **Document State Management:** A new documentation page needs to be created that explain the React Context + useReducer implementation

8.  **Expand Use Cases:** Update the use cases in `docs/business/use-cases.md` to reflect the new features. For example:
   *   **Registered Users:** Save favorite recipes, rate recipes, manage dietary preferences.
   *   **Community:** Share recipes, comment on recipes, interact with other users.

9.  **Document n8n Workflow Implementation:** Add a section or a new document detailing the n8n workflow design, its advantages, implementation steps, configuration, and comparison with GitHub Actions. Use the content of `n8n-workflow-design.md` as the base.
