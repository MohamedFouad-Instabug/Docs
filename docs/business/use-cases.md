*   **Business Features:** Introduced user registration/login, user profiles with dietary preferences, recipe rating/review system, and advanced search/filtering.
*   **UI/UX Improvements:** Redesigned the UI with a glassmorphism aesthetic, created reusable components, and added interactive elements.
*   **New Technologies:** Added dependencies like `react-router-dom`, `axios`, `jwt-decode`, `react-hook-form`, `react-query`, `react-hot-toast`, `framer-motion`, `react-intersection-observer`, `react-virtualized`, `date-fns`, `lodash`, and `clsx`.
*   **Development Tools:** Integrated ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript for enhanced code quality.
