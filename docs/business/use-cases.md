The application has been completely transformed into RecipeHub 2.0 - a full-featured recipe management platform.  This includes a complete architectural overhaul with new authentication, a service layer, enhanced data structures, UI/UX improvements, and several new business features such as user management, rating/reviews, and advanced search.  The backend structure has also been modified to include greater testability, modularity, and API support.  See CHANGES_SUMMARY.md for a comprehensive list of changes.
