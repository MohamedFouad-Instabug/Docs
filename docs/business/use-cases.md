The application has undergone a major transformation from a simple recipe viewer to a comprehensive recipe management platform named 'RecipeHub'. Key updates include the introduction of user authentication, enhanced recipe data structures, a service layer architecture for API communication, a rating and review system, advanced search and filtering, UI/UX improvements with a modern glassmorphism design, and an automated documentation workflow implemented using n8n. This provides a robust, scalable platform for managing and sharing recipes with social features and personalized user experiences. Details on the specific updates to files like `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md`, `n8n-workflow-design.md`, `package.json`, `src/App.js`, `src/App.css`, `src/context/AuthContext.js`, and `src/services/api.js` can be found in the pull request summary.
