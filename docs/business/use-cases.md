The RecipeHub application has undergone a significant transformation, evolving from a simple recipe viewer to a comprehensive recipe management platform. Key changes include:

*   **Architectural Overhaul:** Implementation of a JWT-based authentication system using React Context API for state management. A service layer architecture was introduced to centralize API communication.
*   **Enhanced Data Structure:** The recipe data structure was expanded to include categories, dietary information, ratings, and user-related data.
*   **Business Features:** New features include user management with registration, login, profiles, dietary restrictions, and a recipe rating and review system.
*   **UI/UX Improvements:** The design has been completely overhauled with a glassmorphism design, modern color scheme, and responsive layout. Several new components, such as Header, Search, Recipe cards and detail view, were added.
*   **Technical Improvements:** Tools like ESLint, Prettier, and Typescript were introduced to enhance code quality. Performance optimizations were implemented with `useEffect` hooks and memoized calculations. Error handling was improved with user-friendly error messages and HTTP status code management.
