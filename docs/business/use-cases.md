# RecipeHub Documentation Updates

This document outlines the updates required to reflect the changes introduced in RecipeHub 2.0.  The application has undergone a significant transformation from a simple recipe viewer to a full-featured recipe management platform.

## 1. Overview

RecipeHub 2.0 introduces several new features and architectural changes:

- **User Authentication:** Implemented a JWT-based authentication system with user registration, login, and profile management.
- **Enhanced Data Structure:** Recipes now include more detailed information such as category, difficulty, prep time, dietary information, ratings, and tags.
- **Service Layer Architecture:** A new service layer (`src/services/api.js`) has been introduced for centralized API communication and error handling.
- **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Users can now search recipes by name, tags, category, dietary restrictions, and difficulty level.
- **Recipe Ratings & Reviews:** A 5-star rating system with user reviews has been added.
- **Social Features:** Recipe sharing and user comments (API ready).
- **UI/UX Overhaul:**  A complete design overhaul with glassmorphism, gradient backgrounds, and improved component structure.
