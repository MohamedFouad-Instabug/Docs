# RecipeHub - Documentation Updates

This document outlines the major updates made in RecipeHub 2.0.

## Architectural Changes

### Authentication System

RecipeHub now includes a JWT-based authentication system using React Context API for global state management. Users can register, login, and manage their profiles. Persistent login sessions are supported using localStorage. The `src/context/AuthContext.js` file manages authentication state, and `src/services/api.js` provides a service layer for authentication-related API calls.

### Service Layer

A new service layer (`src/services/api.js`) has been introduced to centralize API communication. This layer handles error handling, request/response interception for authentication, and provides modular API methods organized by feature domain, including authentication, user management, recipe operations, ratings, social features, file uploads, analytics, and notifications.

### Enhanced Data Structure

The recipe data structure in `src/App.js` has been significantly enhanced to include categories, difficulty, prep time, cook time, servings, dietary information (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free), ratings, and tags.

### State Management Overhaul

State management has been overhauled using React Context and `useReducer` for complex state management. Custom hooks are used for authentication and permissions. Local storage integration ensures persistent user data. Error state management is implemented with proper error handling.

## Business Feature Changes

### User Management System

Users can now register, login, manage their profiles, set dietary restrictions and favorite recipe categories, and save recipes.

### Recipe Rating & Review System

Implemented a 5-star rating system with user reviews, average rating calculations, and recent review displays.

### Advanced Search & Filtering

Real-time search by recipe name and tags, category filtering, dietary filter, and difficulty level filtering have been added.

### Enhanced Recipe Display

Recipe cards with metadata, detailed recipe views with dietary tags, and recipe actions (save, rate, share) have been implemented.

### Social Features

Recipe sharing, user comments, recipe analytics, and user activity tracking have been implemented (API ready).

## UI/UX Improvements

### Complete Design Overhaul

Implemented a glassmorphism design with gradient backgrounds, modern color scheme, consistent spacing, and responsive design. See `src/App.css` for details.

### Component Structure

New components have been added, including a header component, search and filter section, recipe cards, recipe detail view, modal dialogs, rating input, and user preferences modal.

### Interactive Elements

Implemented hover effects, smooth transitions, loading states, fade-in animations, and touch-friendly interactions.

## n8n Workflow for Automated Documentation

An n8n workflow design has been created to automate the documentation process. See `n8n-workflow-design.md` for details. This workflow uses the GitHub trigger to listen to pull request events, extracts PR information, uses Gemini AI for analysis, and creates documentation PRs.

## Package.json Updates

The project name has been changed to "recipehub", the version has been updated to 2.0.0, and new dependencies have been added, including `react-router-dom`, `axios`, `jwt-decode`, `react-hook-form`, `react-query`, `react-hot-toast`, `framer-motion`, `react-intersection-observer`, `react-virtualized`, `date-fns`, `lodash`, and `clsx`. New scripts have been added for linting, formatting, bundle analysis, type checking, and testing.

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes:
- Recipe data structure has been completely changed.
- State management approach has been completely rewritten.
- Styling system has been completely overhauled.
- Authentication is now required for full features.

### Backward Compatibility:
- Basic recipe viewing still works without authentication.
- Ingredient suggestions are still functional.
- Core recipe display is maintained.
