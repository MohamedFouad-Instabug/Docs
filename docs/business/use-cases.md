The RecipeHub 2.0 documentation should be updated to reflect the new authentication system, enhanced data structure, UI/UX improvements (glassmorphism), and the addition of a service layer and rating/review system. Consider updating the use-cases.md to reflect how chefs or users can use the new feature sets.
