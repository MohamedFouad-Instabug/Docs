# RecipeHub 2.0 - Documentation Updates

The application has undergone a significant transformation into RecipeHub 2.0, a full-featured recipe management platform. Key updates include:

- **Architectural Changes:** Introduction of authentication (JWT, React Context API), a service layer for API communication (`src/services/api.js`), enhanced recipe data structure (see `src/App.js`), and a state management overhaul (`src/context/AuthContext.js`).
- **Business Features:** User management (registration, login, profiles, dietary restrictions), recipe rating and review system, advanced search and filtering, enhanced recipe display, and social features (sharing, comments).
- **UI/UX Improvements:** Complete design overhaul with glassmorphism (`src/App.css`), new component structure, and interactive elements.
- **Technical Improvements:**  Code organization (new directory structure in `src/`), error handling, and performance optimizations.
- **Package Updates:** Project renamed to `recipehub`, version updated to 2.0.0, and numerous new dependencies added (see `package.json`).
- **n8n Workflow Integration:**  An automated documentation workflow can be implemented with n8n, as outlined in `n8n-workflow-design.md`.
