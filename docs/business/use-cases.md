# RecipeHub Architecture

## Frontend

The frontend is built using React and styled with custom CSS.  It uses a glassmorphism design with gradient backgrounds and a modern color scheme.

*   `src/App.js`:  The main application component handles overall state, authentication, and recipe display.
*   `src/App.css`:  Provides the styling for the application with a responsive design.
*   Component Structure: The app consists of reusable components like Header, Search Filters, Recipe Cards, Recipe Details, and Modals.

## Backend (Simulated)

While the application currently uses mock data, it's architected for seamless backend integration via an API.

*   `src/services/api.js`:  A centralized API service layer for handling all API communication using fetch.  It includes methods for authentication, user management, recipe operations, and social features.
*   Authentication: The API supports JWT-based authentication and persistent login sessions.
*   State Management: React Context API with useReducer manages global application state, including user authentication and preferences.

# Technical Features

## Authentication

RecipeHub offers user registration, login, and profile management. Users can customize their preferences, dietary restrictions, and save favorite recipes.  Authentication is handled via JWTs.

## Recipe Management

The application supports searching, filtering, and displaying recipes. Users can rate and review recipes, as well as share them with others. Recipe cards display key metadata and dietary information.

## User Interface

RecipeHub features a modern, responsive UI with interactive elements and smooth transitions. A search and filter section allows users to easily find recipes based on name, ingredients, category, dietary restrictions, and difficulty.

## n8n Integration

The `n8n-workflow-design.md` file details how to automate documentation updates using n8n workflows, integrating with GitHub and Gemini AI.

# Migration Notes

*   Recipe data structure has changed substantially.  Refer to `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` for details.
*   State management has been completely rewritten with React Context and useReducer.
*   The styling system has been overhauled.  Components may need updates.
*   Authentication is now required for full feature access.

# Conclusion

RecipeHub has evolved from a basic recipe viewer into a comprehensive platform for managing and sharing recipes. The architectural and feature enhancements lay a strong foundation for future growth and community engagement.
