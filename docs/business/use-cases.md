The application has undergone a major transformation from a simple recipe viewer to a full-featured recipe management platform, RecipeHub 2.0. This includes:

- **Authentication System:** Implemented JWT-based authentication with secure token management, React Context API for global state, persistent login sessions, protected routes, and user profile management.
- **Service Layer Architecture:** Introduced a centralized API service layer (`src/services/api.js`) for streamlined API communication, error handling, and modular API methods for authentication, user management, recipes, ratings, social features, and more.
- **Enhanced Data Structure:** Updated the recipe data structure to include categories, difficulty, prep/cook time, servings, dietary information, ratings, and user data.
- **State Management Overhaul:** Implemented React Context + useReducer for complex state management, custom hooks for authentication and permissions, and local storage integration.
- **User Management System:** Added user registration, login, profiles with dietary restrictions and favorite categories, saved recipes functionality, and a user preferences modal.
- **Recipe Rating & Review System:** Introduced a 5-star rating system with user reviews, average rating calculations, and recent reviews display.
- **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Implemented real-time search, category/dietary/difficulty filtering, and ingredient-based recipe suggestions.
- **Enhanced Recipe Display:** Created recipe cards with metadata, recipe detail view, dietary tags, and recipe actions.
- **UI/UX Improvements:** Complete design overhaul with glassmorphism, gradient backgrounds, modern color scheme, and responsive design.
- **Technical Improvements:** Improved code organization with a new directory structure, comprehensive error handling, and performance optimizations.
- **Automated Documentation:** Implemented an n8n workflow to automatically analyze PR changes and generate documentation.

These changes significantly expand the application's functionality and cater to a wider range of users and use cases.
