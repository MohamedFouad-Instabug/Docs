The RecipeHub application has undergone a major overhaul, evolving from a simple recipe viewer to a comprehensive recipe management platform. Key changes include:

*   **Authentication:** A complete user authentication system has been implemented using JWT, React Context, and localStorage for persistent login sessions and role-based access control. The files 'src/App.js' and 'src/context/AuthContext.js' and 'src/services/api.js' document this change.
*   **Service Layer:** A service layer architecture (src/services/api.js) centralizes API communication, handles errors, and provides modular API methods for authentication, user management, recipe operations, ratings, social features, file uploads, analytics, and notifications.
*   **Enhanced Data Structure:** The recipe data structure has been significantly expanded (src/App.js) to include categories, difficulty, preparation and cook times, servings, dietary information, ratings, and creation metadata.
*   **UI/UX Improvements:** A complete design overhaul has been implemented using glassmorphism, gradient backgrounds, and a modern color scheme (src/App.css).
*   **User Management:** User registration, login, profiles, preferences (dietary restrictions, favorite categories, spice level), and saved recipes are now supported (src/App.js).
*   **Rating & Review System:** A 5-star rating system with user reviews, timestamps, and usernames has been added to recipes (src/App.js).
*   **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Recipes can now be searched and filtered by name, tags, category, dietary restrictions, and difficulty (src/App.js).
*   **Social Features:** Support for recipe sharing, user comments, recipe analytics, and user activity tracking has been integrated (src/App.js).
*   **Automated Documentation:** An n8n workflow has been designed to automatically generate documentation updates based on pull request changes (n8n-workflow-design.md). The n8n workflow utilizes the Gemini AI model.
*   **Package Updates:** The package.json file has been updated to reflect the new dependencies and scripts used in the project.
